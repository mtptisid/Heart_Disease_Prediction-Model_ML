# Heart Disease Prediction

This is a web-based application that predicts the 10-year risk of heart disease based on user-provided health data. It uses a machine learning model to analyze the inputs and provide a prediction.

## Features
- User-friendly form to input personal health data.
- Prediction of the 10-year risk of heart disease.
- Integrated with a machine learning model to process the inputs.
- Bootstrap-based responsive design with a clean UI.
- Gradient navbar and footer for enhanced aesthetics.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A Python-based web framework.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for creating responsive designs.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the webpage.
- **scikit-learn**: The machine learning library used for the prediction model.

## How to Run the Application
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Application**: Start the Flask app by running the following command:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
4. **Access the Application**: Open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the prediction form.

## Input Fields
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Age
- Current Smoker (Yes/No)
- Cigarettes Per Day
- BP Medications (Yes/No)
- Prevalent Stroke (Yes/No)
- Prevalent Hypertension (Yes/No)
- Diabetes (Yes/No)
- Total Cholesterol
- Systolic BP
- Diastolic BP
- BMI
- Heart Rate
- Glucose Level

## Prediction Output
The prediction result will display the risk percentage for developing heart disease in the next 10 years based on the Framingham Heart Study dataset.
